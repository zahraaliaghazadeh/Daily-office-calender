# Daily-office-calender
03/19/2020-daily calendar with 9 time-blocks.

a)  what, why, and how? (project description)

I made the rows in html because it was the simplest first idea that came to me, first just worked on one row and as I go I started adding functionality to it. Right now it can save the things you type in the text boxes but It is not saving in the local storage. I also couldnt figure out how to do the color change for past and present.
I was able to use the moment website and get the date on the screen. I also found a way to just track only the hour of the current moment.



b) Why did you build this project? 

Technically I should have used more of jQuery commands in my project So the reason would have been to practice jQuery. 

c)What problem does it solve?

This project let the user put in information in each time block to schedule their daily events. It is a very useful project. 

d) What did you learn?

I was able to work with the moment website to display the time and also grab only the hour part of the time on the screen. I was able to grab the data entered into the text box input and show it in the console. 

e) What makes your project stand out? 
I am not proud of my project.


f) Areas of improvement?
It s nowhere close to what it should be.
It needs to change color based on past, present and future.
It needs to find a way to not repeat all those rows in html as well as the function in js.
